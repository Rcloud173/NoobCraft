Step 1: Define the Goal
    so my to-do-list should have:
        1. to create a list
        2. to edit the list
        3. to view it
        4. mark them as completed or incomplete
        5. to delet task
        6. to save task 

Step 2: Choose the Data Structure:
    dictionaries to store the data 

Step 3: Design the Menu (Interface):
    something

Step 4: Break Into Functions:
    something

Step 5: Decide on Persistence:
    something

Step 6: Handle Edge Cases:
    pass

Step 7: Optional Features (Add Later):
    pass

If you want to enhance the functionality in the future, you might add:

'6': Mark task as complete/incomplete (if not part of edit)

'7': Save tasks to file

'8': Load tasks from file

'9': Exit program (if it's a persistent menu loop)

Sort or filter tasks by due date, priority, etc. (future improvements)
